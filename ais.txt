AI Plans

Cost Calculation:
Simple: All non-foods are blocking
Semi-Predictive: All self body parts are evaluated for lifetimes. Others are considered blocking.
Predictive: Guess where all parts will be at any given time

Target Selection (Based on rules):
Avoidance: Avoid other snakes.
Cannabal: Avoid self, actively seek others as food
IDGAF: Act is if other snakes do not exist.

Move selection:
AI1: Move randomly. Avoid self and walls.
AI1.1: Poisonous moves are avoided
AI2: Zig-zag and pick up food along the way. Avoid self and walls.
AI3: Hug outside walls as much as possible until near target, then strike.
AI4: Randomly select the next move out of all that would move the snake closer to a target.
AI4.1: Randomly select the next move out of all that would move the snake closer to a target. Of all moves that get snake closer to the food, prefer to hug body / avoid loops.
AI4.2: Randomly select the next move out of all that would move the snake closer to a target. Possible entrapments are considered impassible. (if 0 moves possible at point, fill and recalculate)
